# Eat to Fit

Eat to Fit is a comprehensive web application designed to help users achieve their fitness and nutrition goals. The platform offers personalized nutrition plans, workout routines, and progress tracking to ensure users stay on track and reach their goals. Based on the recommendations from the web, the user can create their own meal plan and workout plan.

## Distinctiveness and Complexity

### Distinctiveness
Unlike typical fitness apps that focus solely on workout routines or nutrition apps that only track food intake, Eat to Fit integrates both aspects to provide a holistic approach to health and wellness. This integration allows users to see the correlation between their diet and exercise. Much different than an e-commerce, mail or search engine web application, this application actually takes into the user's biometric information and makes use of them to generate a nutrition plan and workout plan that fit the user's goal. 

### Complexity
The project demonstrates complexity through its various features and functionalities:
- **User Authentication**: Users can register, log in, and manage/modify their profiles.
- **Nutrition Plans**: Users can select meal plans, then receive a calculated daily nutritional intake, and log their food consumption.
- **Workout Routines**: Users can view recommended exercises, and add/remove their own exercises.
- **AJAX Integration**: The application uses AJAX for seamless form submissions and updates without reloading the page.
- **CSS and JavaScript Use**: The application uses CSS for a decent UX/UI and JavaScript to dynamically remove/add element on the web page.
- **Responsive Navigation Bar**: The navigation bar is desined in a way that if the user uses the application on a mobile device, they can navigate using the navigation bar.

### Additional Information
-The nice images of body parts that you see on the Gym & Fitness page were actually generated by DALL-E 3! 
-When the user clicks on feedback, they are directed to an email box where they can email directly straight to me. 

### Features to be added/improved
-For the box "description" in the adding exercise form, I will implement a custom template filters so that if the user enters a link, the hyperlink shall appear. Otherwise, it would just be plain text of blue color. I did not have the resource to do this and as you can see, each of the exercise description in the current version actually has a hyperlink no matter what was the input. If we click on this hyperlink, it would lead us to nowhere.

-The UX/UI can certainly be improved. I also think about turning the list of workout exercises into a table.

-A daily workout journal for the user to keep track of their progress can certainly be added to each of the workout template.
